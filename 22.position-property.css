/*POSITION PROPERTY
The position property specifies the positioning type for an element.

This property can have one of the following values:

static - This is default
relative
fixed
absolute
sticky
Elements are then positioned to their final location with the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

*/

/*STATIC

Static is the default position of an element. It does not accept properties like top, left, right, or bottom.
Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

An element with position: static; is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
*/
div.static {
  position: static;
  border: 3px solid #73AD21;
}

/*
RELATIVE
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties will cause the element to be adjusted away from its normal 
position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

*/
div {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 10px;
}
.relative {
    position: relative;
    top: 20px;
    left: 30px;
}

/*Box 2 is shifted 20px down and 30px to the right from its normal position.*/

/*
FIXED
An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the 
same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used set the final 
location of the element.
A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
*/

.fixed {
    position: fixed;

}
.content {
    height: 1200px;
    padding: 10px;
}

/*
The fixed element stays at the top-right corner of the viewport even as the user scrolls.*/

/*ABSOLUTE

An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (with position other 
than static). However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, 
and moves along with page scrolling. Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal document flow, 
and can overlap other elements.

    padding: 10px;
}

/*The pink box (.absolute) is positioned 50px down and 50px right within the .container.
It does not affect other elements in the flow.*/

/*STICKY

An element with position: sticky; toggles between a relative and fixed position, depending on the scroll position.
A sticky element is positioned relative until a certain scroll position is reached - then it "sticks" in that
place (like position:fixed).
*/

.sticky {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    background-color: yellow;
    padding: 10px;
}

/*
The sticky element stays at the top of the viewport as you scroll but only within its containing element.*/
