<!--VIEWPORT META TAG-->

<!--The HTML viewport is the visible area of the screen that users see. It changes depending on the device being used. With this approach, we set the width of web pages to match the available screen width, making it 100%. This helps content adapt and look good on any device, ensuring a responsive layout.
