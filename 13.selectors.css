/*SELECTORS*/


/*
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

 1.
 Universal Selector (*): Selects all elements on the page and applies the same style universally

 * {
            color: red;
        }

 2.
 Element Selector: Targets all elements of a specific type, such as paragraphs or headers.
 ex- setting a common font size for all paragraphs
]
        p {
            font-size: 16px;
        }
        
 3.
  Class Selector (.): Applies styles to elements with a specific class attribute. 
  For instance, making all buttons have a blue background.

        .button {
            background-color: blue;
            color: white;
        }
        <body>
            <button class="button">Click Me!</button>
        </body>

 4.
 ID Selector (#): Styles a single element identified by its unique id. 
 For example, changing the background color of a header.

        #header {
            background-color: gray;
        }
        <body>
            <div id="header">this is heading</div>
        </body>

 5.
 Grouping Selector - Applies the same style to multiple elements. 
 Same style can be applied on different elements with the help of grouping.

       h1,h2,h3{
        font-family: sans-serif;
        font-size: 25px;
        color: green;
       }

 6.
  Descendant Selectors: Targets an element inside another, 
  such as paragraphs inside div .For example, styling paragraphs inside a div.

        div p {
            color: red;
        }
        <body>
            <div>
                <p>This paragraph inside a div will be red.</p>
            </div>
        </body>
    
 7.
 Child Selectors -CSS child selector selects all the direct children of a particular element. 
 This is denoted by '>' (Greater than) symbol. 
 It will not select elements that are further nested inside the child elements.

 In this example, we are changing the text color of the direct child element of div element. 
 The para element inside the span tag remains unchanged as it is not a direct child of the div element.
    .myDiv > p {
            color: #04af2f;
        }
<body>
    <div class="myDiv">
        <p>It is a paragraph element. Direct child of div element.</p>
        <span><p>This is a p element inside div but not direct child of div.</p></span>        
    </div>
    <p>This is a p element outside div.</p>    
</body>

 8.
 Adjacent Sibling Selector (+): Styles an element immediately following another .For example, making the first paragraph bold after an h1.

        h1+p {
            font-weight: bold;
        }
    <body>
        <h1>This is a header.</h1>
        <p>This is immediately following the header and is bold.</p>
        <p>This will not be bold.</p>
    </body>
 
 9.
  General Sibling Selector (~): Styles all siblings that follow a specific element. For example, italicizing all paragraphs following an h1.

        h1~p {
            font-style: italic;
        }
    <body>
        <h1>This is a header.</h1>
        <p>This is a sibling of the header and will be italicized.</p>
        <p>This will also be italicized because it's a sibling of the header.</p>
    </body>

 10.
 General Sibling Selectors in CSS - CSS general sibling selector ( "~" ) selects all the elements that are 
 siblings of a specified element sharing the same parent. 
 It will select all matching siblings, not just the one immediately following. 
 
 In this example, we have used general sibling selector to change the text color of 
 all p elements that are immediate siblings of the div element.

 div{
         border: 2px solid #031926;
      }
      div ~ p {
         color: #04af2f;
      }
 <body>
      <p>
         This paragraph is above the div 
         and will not be blue
      </p>
      <div>
         <p>
            This paragraph is inside a div 
            and will not be blue.
         </p>
      </div>
      <p>
         This paragraph 1 after the div 
         and will be blue.
      </p>
      <p>This paragraph 2 after the 
         div and will be blue.
      </p>
 </body>

 11.
 Adjacent Sibling Selectors in CSS - CSS adjacent sibling selector or next sibling selector 
 selects an element that is immediately after another element. 
 It is used to select only those elements which immediately follow the first selector. 
 Both elements should share the same parent.
 
 In this example, the style is applied only to the p element which is just after the div element. 
 The other p elements remain unaffected.

 div{
         border: 2px solid #031926;
      }
      div + p {
         color: #04af2f;
      }
 <body>
      <p>
         This paragraph is above the div 
         and will not be green.
      </p>
      <div>
         <p>
            This paragraph is inside a div 
            and will not be green..
         </p>
      </div>
      <p>
         This paragraph 1 after the div 
         and will be green..
      </p>
      <p>This paragraph 2 after the 
         div and will not be green..
      </p>
 </body>

 12.
  Presence Selector: It selects elements that contain a specific attribute. For example, styling all inputs with a type attribute.

        input[type] {
            border: 2px solid black;
        }
 <body>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Text input">
    <input type="number" placeholder="Number input">
 </body>

 13. Attribute Value Selector: It targets elements with a particular attribute value. For example, styling text inputs.

    <style>
        input[type="text"] {
            background-color: yellow;
        }
 
 <body>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Text input">
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password input">
 </body>

 14. Substring Matching(^=): It matches elements where the attribute contains a substring. 
 For example, styling links with https in their href.

        a[href^="https"] {
            color: green;
        }
 
 <body>
    <a href="https://example.com/">Secure link</a>
    <a href="http://example.com/">Non-secure link</a>
 </body>

 15. Wildcard Selector (*=): Matches elements where the attribute value contains a specific string. For example, underlining links with example in the URL.

    <style>
        a[href*="example"] {
            text-decoration: underline;
        }
 <body>
    <a href="https://example.com/">This contains 'example' and is underlined.</a>
    <a href="https://otherlink.com">This is not underlined.</a>
 </body>

 Pseudo-Classes
 Pseudo-classes in CSS define the special states of elements for styling-

 1.
  :hover: Styles elements when the user hovers over them. For example, changing the color of a link when hovered.

        a:hover {
            color: red;
        }
 <body>
    <a href="https://example.com/">Hover over this to see the effect.</a>
 </body>

 2.
 :focus:  Applies styles when an element (like an input field) is focused .When a user clicks or tabs into an input field, the border changes to green and the outline is removed.

        input:focus {

            outline: none;
        }
​
        input {
            border: 1px solid gray;
            padding: 5px;
