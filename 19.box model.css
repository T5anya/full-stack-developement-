/*
Key components of the box model
Each element in the box model is made up of distinct layers that define its size and spacing on a web page.

1. Content Area
The content area is the central part of the CSS box model, containing the main content (e.g., text, images, videos, or elements like <p> or <span>).

The content edge refers to the four edges of the content area.
Left content edge
Right content edge
Top content edge
Bottom content edge

2. Padding Area
The padding area is the space between the content and the border of an element.
The padding area contributes to the element's total dimensions.

3. Border Area
The area that marks the end of an element is called as the border it is the outer fencing for the element.
The border area also add 's up to the complete height and width of the element.
The more the border width the more will be the height or width of the element.

4. Margin Area
The area outside the border of an element is called the margin area.
Basically this area depends on the parent of the element.
The distance between the border of the parent element and the border of the child element is called as the margin.

Box Sizing Property in CSS
There are two type's of box-sizing properties in CSS

1. Content-Box(default property)
When the user set's the value of the box-sizing property for an element as content-box or even if user do not 
set's it ,it remains by default as content-box and in the actual height and width of the element the dimensions 
of the content area as well as the padding area is added to constitute the final dimensions of the element.

Ex-
*/
div {
    height: 20px;
    width: 20px;
    box-sizing: content-box;
    padding-left: 20px;
    padding-right: 20px;
    border-left: 5px solid red;
    border-right: 5px solid red;
}

/*
Content Area (Width) :The width of the content area is fixed at 200px.

Padding-
Total padding width: 20px + 20px = 40px

Border-
Line Width of Border: 0.4px (the width of the line itself)
Area of Border: 1.6px (the actual space the border occupies visually)
Border width for both sides: 1.6px (left) + 1.6px (right) = 3.2px

Total Width-
Formula for Total Width = (Padding-Left + Padding-Right + Border-Area-Left + Border-Area-Right) + Content Area Width
Total Width = (20px + 20px + 1.6px + 1.6px) + 200px = 243.2px
The total width of the element becomes 243.2px.

The reason the total width is increased unexpectedly is because box-sizing: content-box applies the width to the content area only


2. Border-Box
When the box-sizing property is set as border-box the actual dimensions of the element's remains same as that 
of the actual dimensions set by the user. The difference it makes is just that the size of the content area get's 
altered in a manner so that it could accommodate the padding area and the border area so the resultant could be
equal to the actual dimensions entered by the user.

Ex-
*/
div {
    height: 20px;
    width: 70px;
    box-sizing:border-box;
    padding-left: 20px;
    padding-right: 20px;
    border-left: 2px solid red;
    border-right: 2px solid red;
}
/*

Width of Border and Padding Border width : 0.4px (line width) and 1.6px + 1.6px = 3.2px (total border area).

Padding width : 20px + 20px = 40px.

User-Entered Width : The width entered by the user is 200px, which applies to the content area only when box-
sizing: content-box is used.

Box-Sizing Behavior :The box-sizing: content-box property adds the padding and border outside the content area, 
causing the total width to increase.

Adjusting Content Area Width : To ensure the total width remains 200px, the extra width from padding and borders 
(40px + 3.2px = 43.2px) is subtracted from the total width.

New content area width : 200px - 43.2px = 156.8px.

Final Width Calculation : The final total width is: 156.8px (content area) + 40px (padding) + 3.2px (border) = 200px, ensuring the user’s entered width remains unchanged.
