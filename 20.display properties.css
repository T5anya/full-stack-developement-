/* DISPLAY PROPERTIES 

The CSS display property determines how an element is displayed on a webpage, defining its layout behavior and how it interacts with other elements.

It specifies the type of rendering box an element generates.
Controls whether an element is shown as a block, inline, flex, grid, etc.
Affects the layout structure and overall page flow.

Understanding the Display Property
The display property defines how an HTML element should be displayed. It controls the box type generated by an element, affecting its positioning and behavior within the document flow. Let’s dive into the key values:

1. Using Display Block
This is the default property for <div> elements. It places them vertically, one after another. You can adjust the height and width of a block-level element.

#geeks1 {
       background: teal;
       display: block;
}
#geeks2 {
       background: cyan;
       display: block;
}
#geeks3 {
       background: green;
       display: block;
}

/*
2. Using Inline Display
Use this property to display an element inline. It doesn’t start a new line and respects the content flow.
*/
#geeks1 {
       background: teal;
       display: inline;
}
#geeks2 {
       background: cyan;
       display: inline;
}
#geeks3 {
       background: green;
       display: inline;
}
/*
3. Using Display Inline-block
Combining characteristics of both block and inline, this value allows elements to flow inline while still having block-level properties. It’s useful for creating responsive layouts.
*/
#geeks1 
{
        background: teal;
        display: inline-block;
} 
#geeks2 {
        background: cyan;
        display: inline-block; 
} 
#geeks3 {
        background: green;
        display: inline-block;
}

/*
4. Using Display None
This property hides the div or the container which use this property. Using it on one of the div it will make working clear. 
*/
#geeks2 {
         background: cyan;
         display: none;
} 

/*
Hide an Element - Use display:none or visibility:hidden

Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none. The element will be hidden, and the page 
will be displayed as if the element is not there:
You can also use visibility:hidden; to hide an element.

However, with this property, the element will be hidden, but it will still take up the same space as if 
it was visible
