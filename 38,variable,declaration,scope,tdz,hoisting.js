Block Scope → Code inside {} like in loops, if , etc.

/*
JavaScript prepares memory before running code.
It moves all declarations to the top — this is called hoisting.

var is hoisted and set to undefined
let and const are hoisted but not initialized — so accessing them early gives
ReferenceError
